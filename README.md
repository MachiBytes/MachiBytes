  <summary><h3>Aki's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I started my coding journey during my 3rd year in junior high school. We had an ICT class where we were taught about the usual stuff like the history of computers and the parts of computers, but we were also taught about HTML and CSS. This was the first time I was introduced to the world of programming and I instantly fell in love. Since then, I knew that it was the right career for me. I started grinding out and making my own websites, but I was never satisfied because the creative process is a bit difficult. Fast forward to January of 2020, my friend introduced me to Python. It was an exhilirating experience. Python combined my newfound love of programming with my passion for puzzles and problem solving. Around March of 2020, the Covid-19 Pandemic started in the Philippines and I dedicated 2-3 years of my life into just learning Python. Because of Python, I have a lot of concepts understood and I can easily switch to other programming languages. Now, I am currently trying to pursue a career in Data Science but I'm still open to exploration and I'm excited to see what lies ahead in my programming journey. - Aki, May 2023
